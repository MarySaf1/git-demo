A song is a musical composition intended to 
be performed by the human voice
standing strong

Ever had a song stuck in your head that 
just keeps playing over and over but you can’t 
recall the name or even the words?

Then this may be music to your ears. Google 
now offers a simple cure for earworms or stuck 
song syndrome: You can hum, whistle or sing the tune, 
even off key, and Google will rustle up a short list of possibilities.
